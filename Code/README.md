BUBBLE MELTDOWN:

Controls:

2. Z and X can be used to zoom in and out respectively.

3. w,a,s,d are used for panning across the level and should be handled similar to the arrow keys

4. Press escape to quit the game.


Rules:

The world has a small blue semi-circular pond filled with water, while moving in this pond, the player's vertical speed is reduced due to water resistance.

Several bubbles in different shades of greenish blue are moving around the level. Jumping on the balls boosts a player up in the air while popping the bubble and increasing the score of the player. Balls at higher levels give more points!!!

A magnet keeps teleporting to opposite edges of the screen. This magnet pulls the player towards it when both are at the same vertical height above the ground.

A red porcupine can be found moving on the ground. Touching this porcupine resets the position of both player and the porcupine while also reducing your score by 80.

A black spring/ trampoline can be found in the level. Jump on this spring to go very high in the air, giving you access to the balls on the higher levels. 


When the player surpasses a score of 180 points a power up is activated and time slows down for a limited period, making it easier for the player to score more points as he/she still moves at normal speed.

Similarly, crossing a score of 360 causes all of the bubbles to suddenly fall into the pool, giving the player an easy chance to score even more points. Once popped, the bubbles go back to moving across the screen.
